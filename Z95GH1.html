    <h1 class="article_title">Introducing Vertigo Onyx: EU Competitive Team</h1>
      <p class="article_date">1/31/2016</p>
        <p class="article_author">By: Vertigo Studios</p>

        <p class="article_txt">After Vertigo’s successful finish in the Autumn Season, placing 5th in the North American Live Finals, Team Vertigo eSports has now successfully entered uncharted territory for a Vainglory Organization. Vertigo is proud to announce the formation of an overseas team from the EU region, Vertigo Onyx!</p>
        <p class="article_txt">Vertigo Onyx has competed in the first VGL Winter Qualifiers and other big competitions (i.e VMS), surprising Europe with a high level skill of play. Our other competitive teams, Vertigo Black and Vertigo Diamond, are excited to be working with Vertigo Onyx as these three teams will push the boundaries of cross region METAs.</p>
        <p class="article_txt">Along with being a competitive team Vertigo Onyx has created a community guild, Vertigo EU, which is open to all. Striving to create a positive community for all players throughout Europe, Vertigo EU has become a very active guild.  So if you are in Europe and looking to support our community, joining Vertigo EU!</p>
        <p class="article_txt">Vertigo is proud to introduce you to the team who we call Vertigo Onyx.</p>

        <p class="article_header">Captain/Support: Defalt</p>
          <p class="article_txt"> D3falt currently lives in France. He started playing Vainglory in February 2015 after receiving a new phone. Despite having no previous MOBA experience, D3falt was able to achieve a preseason ranking of Pinnacle of Awesome. In November 2015, he talked with leaders, Josh, DragonBorne, and Frostglaive about expanding Vertigo to the EU server and becoming the first guild to do so. The decision was made and D3falt is now the leader of the EU branch, and takes on the responsibility of recruiting new talents and making the branch grow. When asked about his view on his new role, D3falt responded, “I am proud to be a part of this awesome adventure. I know we can compete in Europe, I just wanted to give Vertigo the power to do it!” And as a positive person, D3falt quoted his philosophy as: “Knowledge and awareness are vague, and perhaps better called illusions. Everyone lives inside their own subjective interpretations.”</p>

        <p class="article_header">Laner: PierreAubry</p>
          <p class="article_txt">Like D3falt, Pierre lives in France. He discovered Vainglory on the AppStore in September 2014, and finished both the preseason and Autumn Season in the Pinnacle of Awesome ranking. He briefly played League of Legends but did not enjoy it too much, instead he chose Vainglory because of its ability to be played on mobile devices.</p>
            <p class="article_txt">“I found Vertigo to be very strong, from a stream that I saw. I am happy to be a part of it because after each tournament, they take care of us, of our mentality and our progression, as well as encourage us. Each victory is a reward of regular training and each defeat is a lesson.”</p>

        <p class="article_header">Jungler: Fwier</p>
          <p class="article_txt">Fwier is one of the junglers for Vertigo Onyx, and like the rest of the starting lineup, lives in France. While he may be bit of a more reserved person, he does not hesitate to make his jungle presence known, as he is a dominant jungler who reached Pinnacle of Awesome in the Autumn Season.</p>

        <p class="article_header">Support: HEaVRhielonl</p>
          <p class="article_txt">Rhielon is one of the roamers for the team. He currently works as an IT engineer in Europe and has been playing Vainglory since its release in Europe. At 42 years old and with a sense of humor, he calls himself the “grandpa of this game” however, no one should underestimate him by his age because he achieved a ranking of Pinnacle of Awesome in both Season 0 and Season 1.</p>
            <p class="article_txt">“I do like playing as a support as it’s the most strategic position. Damn, you got caned by the old guy!”</p>

          <p class="article_txt">You can catch this team in action on the Vainglory Master Series and VaingloryLeague EU.</p>
